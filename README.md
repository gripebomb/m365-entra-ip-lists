## Formatting Standard

All list files are plain text with one CIDR per line, for example:

```text
203.0.113.0/24
198.51.100.10/32
```

## Intended Microsoft 365 / Entra Usage

- Use files in `lists/providers/` when one named location per provider is acceptable.
- Use files in `lists/chunks/` when you need to split uploads into multiple named locations due to platform limits.
- Use `lists/combined/aws-ipv4-ranges.txt` (or its chunks) for broad AWS range coverage.

## Maintenance Workflow

1. Replace or regenerate provider source files.
2. Re-split large files into `lists/chunks/<provider>/` as needed.
3. Validate with line counts (`wc -l`) before committing.
4. Commit with a date-stamped message indicating refresh source and date.

## Notes

- Chunk files may be identical to canonical files for smaller providers; they are kept for naming consistency in upload workflows.
- This repository currently contains IPv4 CIDR lists only.
